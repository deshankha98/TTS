# TTS
A collection of code implementing various text-to-speech models
The code implementation shows audio data augmentation(adding noise with specified snr, prefixing and suffixing silence audio and trimming the audio dataset). The code contains a few samples of finetuning TTS models (FreeVC24, VITS) on the augmented data and executing the finetuned model to generate audio. The implementation was only covering finetuning and generating audio data for some speific keywords(single keywords to be used for ASR) in English and Hindi language. For finetuning code samples look at [[Finetuning]](https://github.com/deshankha98/TTS/tree/main/finetuning_examples/vits/english) and the audio files need to be arranged in specific formats for finetuning different TTS models, for commented codes look at [[DataFactory]](https://github.com/deshankha98/TTS/tree/main/finetuning_dataset_creation).
